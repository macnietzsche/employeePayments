# ACME - Salary calculation
ACME has decided to develop an application to calculate the amount in USD to pay an employee, based on the quantity of hours and the time they worked. Therefore, the hour fee is calculated based in the table below:

|                     | Monday (MO) | Tuesday (TU) | Wednesday (WE) | Thursday (TH) | Friday (FR) | Saturday (SA) | Sunday (SU) |
| :----:              | :----: | :----:  | :----:    | :----:   | :----: | :----:   | :----: |
|00:01 - 09:00 |25      |25       |25         |25        |25      |30        |30      |
|09:01 - 18:00 |15      |15       |15         |15        |15      |20        |20      |
